# API-WeatherPy

Welcome to my WeatherPy/VacationPy challenge!
In the VacationPy file you will find the jupyter notebook with all my notations on where you can have the perfect weather vacation without having the hassel of searching around for it. Included in with this, is a picture of 4 hotel places that you can stay at close to the vicinity.
In my WeatherPy, I have included multiple picturees of the plots and of course, the Weatherpy jupyter notebook file. 

As always,
I encourage detailed responses in order to better myself in this field. 

Thank you for your time and have a marvelous day!
